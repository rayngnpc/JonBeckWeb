## Code Quality Standards
- Ensure all code is properly formatted and follows consistent style
- Write meaningful commit messages that explain the "why" behind changes
- Keep changes focused and atomic - one logical change per commit

- Ensure existing tests pass before submitting changes
- Aim for good test coverage of critical functionality
- Include both positive and negative test cases

## Documentation
- Update README.md when adding new features or changing functionality
- Document public APIs, functions, and classes
- Include usage examples for complex features
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes

## Security

- Validate and sanitize user inputs
- Follow security best practices for the technology stack
- Keep dependencies up to date

## Best Practices
- Use version control effectively with clear, descriptive commit messages
